# Fight Foundation

> The open protocol powering the Fight ecosystem — identity, reputation, and tokenized participation across combat sports.

The **Fight Foundation** maintains the technical and governance infrastructure behind the **Fight ecosystem**, including the $FIGHT token, Fight.ID, and the reputation and staking systems that connect fans, fighters, and partners across the combat sports world.

This organization serves as the central home for all public-facing repositories, documentation, and assets supporting the Fight protocol.

## Mission

To build an open, decentralized framework that:
- Connects every fight fan and athlete through a shared on-chain identity.
- Rewards engagement and loyalty through transparent tokenized systems.
- Enables developers and partners to extend the Fight ecosystem through composable smart contracts and APIs.
